TODO
====

* add unit tests
  - converting resulting PDF (like tests/test-8p.pdf) to text and check order
  - pyPdf.PdfFileReader.getPage(i).extractText()
* add support for US paper sizes
  "We use Statement (5.5" X 8.5"), Letter (8.5" X 11"), and Tabloid (11" X 17")
  sizes. Each of these are progressively exactly twice the size of the previous
  size.  So we take two 5.5" X 8.5" pages and put them on one 11" X 8.5" piece
  of paper. Then we can also take two 8.5" X 11" pages and put them on one 17"
  X 11" piece of paper. It is very similar to the A5, A4, and A3 paper sizes."
* pdfimposer: add blank pages so that the booklet always work
  â†’ cannot reproduce, more info needed
* bookletimposer.gui: "apply" active with no input file selected:
  - select an input file
  - return to input file selection dialog
  - press Esc
  - "apply" is still active but trigger an error
  When getting Esc press, the UI is updated with "(None)" which is *not* the
  case if the user press "Cancel" button, but "file-set" is not called.
  This seems to be a GTK bug with no easy workaround.
* pdfimposer: transform exceptions so that i18n is not necessary
* bookletimposer.gui: use previews
* try to run with pypy as psyco is deprecated and thus dropped
