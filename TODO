* bookletimposer.gui: "apply" active with no input file selected:
  - select an input file
  - return to input file selection dialog
  - press Esc
  - "apply" is still active but trigger an error
  When getting Esc press, the UI is updated with "(None)" which is *not* the
  case if the user press "Cancel" button, but "file-set" is not called.
  This seems to be a GTK bug with no easy workaround.
* bookletimposer.gui: do not use same mnemonics for "À propos" and "Appliquer"
* bookletimposer.gui: add a keyboard shortcut to quit (e.g. CTRL-q, ESC)
* pdfimposer: transform exceptions so that i18n is not necessary
* bookletimposer.gui: use previews
* try to run with pypy as psyco is deprecated and thus dropped
