About
=====

*Bookletimposer* is an utility to achieve some basic imposition on PDF
documents, especially designed to work on booklets.

*Bookletimposer* is implemented as a commandline and GTK+ interface to *pdfimposer*,
a reusable python module built on top of [pyPdf2](https://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/).

It was tested on GNU/Linux althought it may work on any systems with a Python
interpreter.

Bookletimposer and pdfimposer are both free software released under the GNU
General Public License, either [version
3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html) or (at your option) any
later version.

Features
--------

- produce a booklet out of a linear document;
- produce a linear document out of a booklet;
- reduce a document to put many pages on every sheet.

BookletImposer isn't able to merge multiple PDF files. We advise you to use
[pdfshuffler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfshuffler/) if you need such a
feature; pdfshuffler is 
[available in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/pdfshuffler).
