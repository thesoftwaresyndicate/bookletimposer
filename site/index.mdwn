About
=====

*pdfimposer* is a python module to achieve some basic imposition on PDF documents,
especially designed to work on booklets. It is implemented on top of 
[pyPdf](http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/). It was tested on GNU/Linux although it
should work on any system with a Python interpreter. 

*BookletImposer* is a commandline and GTK+ interface to *pdfimposer*.

They are both free software released under
[GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html)

Features
--------

- produce a booklet out of a linear documents
- produce a linear document out of a booklet
- reduce a document to put many pages on every sheet

BookletImposer isn't able to merge multiple PDF files. We advise you to use
[pdfshuffler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfshuffler/) if you need such a
feature; pdfshuffler is 
[available in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/pdfshuffler).
